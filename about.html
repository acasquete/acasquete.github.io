            <h3>First job as a programmer in Micro 3 Services</h3>
            <p>My first professional experience for a company that provided call center, telemarketing, and development services. I started as an operator in the Dinamic Multimedia customer service call center to give technical support to several games, but I soon became involved in the development areas. And there, I was focused on designing and developing my first client-server desktop applications using Visual Basic and SQL Server, web applications using ASP, and interactive catalogs using Macromedia Authorware and Director.</p>

            <h3>Studio 4, First company founded</h3>
            <p>After my first 4 years of experience, I decided to start with three colleagues from the previous company, a new company on our own. During this time, I was involved in the entire sales and delivery cycle. I did everything from acquiring clients and first meetings to the proposal's definition, development, and delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of the time was dedicated to creating the first websites for companies in different sectors, using Flash and PHP and MySQL as the backend. I also deep-dived into "more serious" projects, in which I had the opportunity to develop a content management system of websites for a political party campaign in general elections, using PHP and Filemaker. I designed and developed an application for patient monitoring and assistance in Parkinson's surgeries at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona using Visual Basic and SQL Server. And finally, in one of these developments, I had the opportunity to start using ASP.NET in its first version to create a vehicle configuration system.</p>

            <h3>New stage as a freelance and external consultant</h3>

            <p>After the stage with my own company, I continued as a freelancer, working exclusively for an agency specialized in technical advice, enterprise web development, and online marketing. I was responsible for getting the customer requirements, effort estimates, and designing the technological solution. </p>

            <p>During this time, I was dedicated to developing web applications with the LAMP stack in sectors as diverse as travel, music, and auctions. In these projects, I used CodeIgniter and Zend PHP frameworks. </p>
                
             <p>In addition to the projects in PHP, I was able to participate in the design and development of an interactive system for a multimedia information point for data capture for a wine company. In this project, I introduced the .NET stack for the first time using AJAX.</p>
                
        <p> In the final stage, I was involved in the technical analysis and development of a multichannel platform for online banking services. And, as an external advisor, I was responsible for developing the restyling of a web portal for a publishing company. In this project, in addition to defining the guidelines and best practices for the multi-browser approach, I actively developed the new interface to the new corporate image using web usability standards and accessibility. Both projects used ASP.NET and MS SQL.</p>

            <h3>Wolters Kluwer</h3>
            <p>During this period my first experiences began as part of a great development team. I started at WKE through Entel (now Entelgy), and soon after, I became part of the staff. Initially, I was focused on the development of the human resources and payroll management web application restyling. The stack used was ASP.NET and MS SQL, with a strong focus on the frontend with HTML, CSS, and pure Javascript.
            </p><p>
                Then I went on, as an analyst, to perform the requirements analysis, the definition of the functional and technical analyzes of the evolutionary developments of the payroll and human resources application.
            </p><p>  
                In the last stage, I was responsible in Spain for accepting and validating the architecture design of a European development platform for multi-hosting applications in WPF, Silverlight, and ASP.NET. I collaborated with the Italian and Belgian offices to migrate the existing development environment to .NET and verify that the architecture implementation met local requirements and best design practices.
            </p><p>
                During this time, I began to acquire interest and deep knowledge about design patterns, best development practices in both backend and databases, and learn about DDD, distributed systems, aspect-oriented programming, and technologies such as PostSharp, Enterprise Library, Entity Framework, Unity, Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET and MS SQL.</p>

            <p>At this stage, I began my career in consulting companies. For 2 years, I was involved in developing a WPF application for notaries management. I was integrated into a team with 20 developers and functional analysts. In this project, I focused on defining and applying best practices, unit tests, functional tests, and performance analysis.
</p><p>
                In the final stage, I was involved in developing the application of ticketing management for soccer competitions. The application used WPF with Prism framework and MS SQL Server. I also developed the resale website for the same competitions, in this case, using ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQL Server, and Knockout for the frontend.
            </p><p>
                During this time, I began to spend part of my time with community events as an assistant, speaker, organizer, and writing technical articles. With the release of Windows 8, I was very involved in evangelizing technology and developing mobile and desktop applications using XAML and Javascript. I was finally awarded as Microsoft MVP for these contributions.</p>

The main project was the design and development of a notification delivery system for a real estate portal, where the biggest challenge was improving the performance of SQL Server stored procedures.
</p><p>
Later I participated in minor developments, such as the development of a document management solution integrated with Sharepoint, and several mobile application developments for Windows 8 and Windows Phone platforms.

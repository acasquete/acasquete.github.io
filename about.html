            <h3>First job as a programmer in Micro 3 Services</h3>
            <p>My first professional experience for a company that provided call center, telemarketing, and development services. I started as an operator in the Dinamic Multimedia customer service call center to give technical support to several games, but I soon became involved in the development areas. And there, I was focused on designing and developing my first client-server desktop applications using Visual Basic and SQL Server, web applications using ASP, and interactive catalogs using Macromedia Authorware and Director.</p>

        <div class="item right">
            <h3>Found first company Studio 4</h3>
            <p>After my first 4 years of experience, I decided to start with three colleagues from the previous company, a new company on our own. During this time, I was involved in the entire sales and delivery cycle. I did everything from acquiring clients and first meetings to the proposal's definition, development, and delivery.

            <p>
                Part of the time was dedicated to creating the first websites for companies in different sectors, using Flash and PHP and MySQL as the backend. I also deep-dived into "more serious" projects, in which I had the opportunity to develop a content management system of websites for a political party campaign in general elections, using PHP and Filemaker. I designed and developed an application for patient monitoring and assistance in Parkinson's surgeries at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona using Visual Basic and SQL Server. And finally, in one of these developments, I had the opportunity to start using ASP.NET in its first version to create a vehicle configuration system.</p>

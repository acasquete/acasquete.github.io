            <h3>First job as a programmer in Micro 3 Services</h3>
            <p>My first professional experience for a company that provided call center, telemarketing, and development services. I started as an operator in the Dinamic Multimedia customer service call center to give technical support to several games, but I soon became involved in the development areas. And there, I was focused on designing and developing my first client-server desktop applications using Visual Basic and SQL Server, web applications using ASP, and interactive catalogs using Macromedia Authorware and Director.</p>

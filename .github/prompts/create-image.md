Create an image of a 3D book lying on a smooth surface. The book should appear slightly tilted in perspective, clearly showing the full front cover. Use soft lighting and a minimalistic pastel-tone background. The style should be clean and modern, with subtle shadows that enhance the three-dimensional effect. Replace the cover with the reference image. Keep well-defined edges, a realistic book thickness, and a natural sense of volume.

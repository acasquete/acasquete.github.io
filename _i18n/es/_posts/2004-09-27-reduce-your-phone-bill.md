A few days ago, a customer told me to try [Skype](http://www.skype.com), a new communication software using P2P technology developed by the creators of [Kazaa](http://www.kazaa.com) and [Joltid](http://www.joltid.com). At first, I didn't give it much thought because I thought I would find no improvement compared to other applications I had tried so far, but I was wrong. Today I found that the sound quality is good, like that of a standard phone, with no delays. It allows conferences of up to 5 people and works with all firewalls, NATs and routers.

So if you have Skype installed, you can call me [here](callto://alexcasquete).

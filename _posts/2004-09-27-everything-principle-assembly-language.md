title: Everything principle, Assembly Language
---
These are the book that should be in all developer libraries: [The Art of Assembly Language](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1886411972/ref=pd_sim_books_1/103-7435513-2805404?v=glance&s=books) by Randall Hyde and [Assembly Language Step-by-step: Programming with DOS and Linux](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471375233/ref=ase_whizkidtechnomag/103-7435513-2805404?v=glance&s=books) by Jeff Duntermann.  
  
For the most advanced developers, this [tutorial](http://www.int80h.org) will attempt to show us how we can use assembly language writing Unix programs, specifically under [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org).

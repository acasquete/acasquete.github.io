title: Music piracy
---
I do not believe that high prices of CDs imposed by the record industry are responsible for the piracy. They have all the right to set the prices that they want. There are many other things that seem to me much more expensive and even so I pay for them. I believe that the main problem is much more serious that just an enterprise policy of prices.  
  
The record industries have not adapted to new technologies. And instead of reacting to improve his situation, they have chosen a worse way, aided by the government. They have used piracy to criminalize to all Internet users and they have imposed a canon for the CD sale, moving away from a real solution. They have never looked for a solution, but to make money at all costs.  
  
The government would have to facilitate free access to the music and to the culture, and now internet is the best media that allows it.

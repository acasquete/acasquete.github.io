I don't believe that the high CD prices imposed by the recording industry are responsible for piracy. They have the right to set the prices they want. There are many other things that I find much more expensive and I still pay for them. I think the main problem is much more serious than a simple corporate pricing policy.  
  
The recording industries have not adapted to the new technologies. And instead of reacting to improve their situation, they have opted for a worse way, asking for help from the government. They have used piracy to criminalize all Internet users and have imposed a royalty on the sale of CDs, moving away from a real solution. They have never sought a solution, but to make money at whatever cost.  
  
The government should facilitate free access to music and culture, and now the Internet is the best way to do it.

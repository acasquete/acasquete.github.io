This year, the celebrations of the Mercè finished 26 September with the traditional «Piromusical». The event took place in Maria Cristina avenue (Montjuïc) at ten o'clock with a massive affluence. The musical selection was in charge of [Pep Sala](http://www.pepsala.com/).  
  
I recorded with [Mr. Galisteo](http://spaces.msn.com/members/galisteo23/)'s camera two minutes of show and I have uploaded the video into my [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) account. The song that sounds is «[És inútil continuar](http://www.2famouslyrics.com/s/sau/es-inutil-continuar.html)» (It's useless to continue) of Sau.

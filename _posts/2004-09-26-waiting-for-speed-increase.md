Since a couple of months ago, when [Telefónica](http://www.telefonica.es) announced an increase in the speed of ADSL lines in Spain while maintaining the same price, we have all been impatient to enjoy a few measly extra kilobits.

In Barcelona, the increase is scheduled to take place between 29 September and 20 October. In the meantime, Telefónica has made available a [web](http://www.telefonicaonline.com/on/es/servnav/on.html?servicio=entrada&entrada=masvelocidad) to check the dates when the increase is scheduled.

I am now "enjoying" 256 Kb, so I hope to be able to surf at double speed soon.

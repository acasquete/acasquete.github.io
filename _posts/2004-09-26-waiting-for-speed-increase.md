title: Waiting for speed increase
---
For a couple of months, when [Telefónica] (http://www.telefonica.es) announced the increase in the speed of ADSL lines in Spain while maintaining the same price, we are all impatient to enjoy a miserable extra kilobits.

In Barcelona the increase is expected between September 29 and October 20. Meanwhile, Telefónica has made available to all of us a [web](http://www.telefonicaonline.com/on/es/servnav/on.html?servicio=entrada&entrada=masvelocidad) to check the dates on which it is planned the increase. 

I am "enjoying" 256 Kb, so I hope to be able to surf at double speed soon.

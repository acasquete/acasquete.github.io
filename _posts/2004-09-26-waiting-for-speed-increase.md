title: Waiting for speed increase
---
For a couple of months, when [Telef�nica de Espa�a](http://www.telefonica.es) announced the increase speed of ADSL lines in Spain maintaining the same price, we all are impatient to enjoy some miserable kilobits of more. In Barcelona the increase is foreseen between September 29 and October 20. Telef�nica has put to disposition for all of us a [web](http://www.telefonicaonline.com/on/es/servnav/on.html?servicio=entrada&entrada=masvelocidad) to consult the dates in those that are foreseen the increase. I'm "enjoying" 256 Kb, so I hope soon I can be surf to twice as much.

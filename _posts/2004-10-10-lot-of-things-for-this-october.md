title: A lot of things for this October
---
This October is being very exciting due to all events that are taking place.  
  
The first one is that, finally, I'm already finishing the project of a web application that has had me busy almost every day of the last five months.  
  
Exciting also for the new initiative of Microsoft for this new year: [Develop with MSDN](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com), _[Desarrolla con MSDN](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com),_ that includes webcasts, chats and a development competition. Last Thursday we attend the first WebCast [Applications development with .NET and Web Services](https://web.archive.org/web/20051124101924/http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/ServiciosWeb/Eventos/Webcast1.aspx), presented by David Carmona, in which we saw an introduction to the development of web services with. NET. In some webcast's moments they had some problems with the sound, but this didn't influence in the final result of the whole webcast.  
  
But this doesn't end up here. Next 18th will have the opportunity to attend another WebCast: [Develops with MSDN: MSDN Video Central Server](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/ServiciosWeb/Eventos/Webcast2.aspx). These webcasts will show step to step how to develop with VS.NET the application MSDN Video and in this webcast they showed us as developing the central server that will serve as core of the rest of clients that will consume the application's functionality. But there's still more...  
  
Next Thursday in the Auditory Winterthur of Barcelona"[TechDay: Enlarging the frontiers of the Active Directory](http://www.microsoft.com/spain/technet/techday/)" with John Craddock, Principal Systems Consultant of Kimberry Associates.  
  
The 20th will attend in the [Facultat d'Inform√É tica de Barcelona](http://www.fib.upc.es/), to the workshop "[Applications Development with. NET and Web Services](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/ServiciosWeb/Eventos/Sesion5.aspx)", also like part of the program Develop with MSDN.  
  
All this only this month, this's the [calendar of events](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/Calendar.aspx) foreseen June 2005...

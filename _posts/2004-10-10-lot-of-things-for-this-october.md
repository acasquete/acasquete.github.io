This October is being very exciting because of all the events that are taking place.

The first is that I am finally finishing the web application project that has kept me busy almost every day for the last five months.  
  
Exciting also because of Microsoft's new initiative for this new year: [Desarrolla con MSDN](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com) (_Develop with MSDN_), which includes webcasts, chats and a development contest. Last Thursday we attended the first WebCast [Application Development with .NET and Web Services](https://web.archive.org/web/20051124101924/http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/ServiciosWeb/Eventos/Webcast1.aspx), presented by David Carmona, in which we saw an introduction to the development of web services with . NET. In some moments of the webcast they had some problems with the sound, but this did not affect the final result of the whole webcast.  
  
But it doesn't end here. Next 18th we will have the opportunity to attend another WebCast: [Develop with MSDN: MSDN Video Central Server](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/ServiciosWeb/Eventos/Webcast2.aspx). This webcast will show step by step how to develop with VS.NET the MSDN Video application and in this webcast they will show us how to develop the central server that will be the core of the rest of the clients that will consume the functionality of the application. But there is still more...  
  
Next Thursday at the Winterthur Auditorium in Barcelona"[TechDay: Pushing the boundaries of Active Directory](http://www.microsoft.com/spain/technet/techday/)" with John Craddock, Principal Systems Consultant at Kimberry Associates.  
  
On the 20th I will attend at the [Facultat d'Inform√†tica de Barcelona](http://www.fib.upc.es/), the workshop [Application Development with . NET and Web Services](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/ServiciosWeb/Eventos/Sesion5.aspx), also as part of the Develop with MSDN programme.   
  
All this just this month, this is the [events calendar](http://www.desarrollaconmsdn.com/msdn/Calendar.aspx) foreseen for June 2005...

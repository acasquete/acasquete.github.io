I am going to take this post as an exercise of sincerity and a declaration of intentions. 
I don't think I really take care of our environment, I don't know if it's because of lack of habit or lack of education. Maybe my lack of ecological sentiment is caused by bigger problems that are not solved.  But there are no excuses. There are many ways to go green in our home.  
  
All we know is that we must remember not to waste electrical energy. We should turn off the lights every time we leave a room. And not to leave the water running when we wash. I think I do that correctly.  
  
But there are two things that have always bothered me. The first is the waste of water every time we go to the bathroom. And the second is oil pollution of the water, with cooking oils and lubricating oils for vehicles.  
  
In summer, there are many cities that suffer long water supply cuts. We can recycle some of the water we use for washing to flush the toilet. I think this is more important than knowing how much water I use when I brush my teeth.  
  
The next problem is oil. Many people pour the oil they no longer use down the water drain. This oil will pollute the water in rivers and seas. The solution to this problem is simple. The oil should be stored in ecological containers. This oil is then recycled and used as fuel. But... Where are these containers?  
  
Disposing of motor oil is more serious because these oils contain toxic products. In the United Kingdom and the United States, it is forbidden to pour oil into the sewer. Here, I see it every day.

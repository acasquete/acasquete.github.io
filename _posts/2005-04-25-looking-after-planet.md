title: Looking after the planet
---
I am going take this post as an exercise of sincerity and a declaration of intentions. I think that I really don't look after our environment, for lack of habit or for lack of education. Perhaps my lack of ecological feeling is triggered by others big problems that are not solved. But there are not excuses. There are a lot of means to be ecological in our home.  
  
All we know that we must remember not to squander the electrical energy. We must to turn the lights off whenever we leave a room. And not to leave the water running when we are washing. I believe that I am doing this correctly.  
  
But there are two things that always worried me. The first it's the waste of water whenever we go to the toilet. And the second it's the water oil pollution, with oils for cooking and lubricating oils for vehicles.  
  
In summer, there are many cities that have long cuts of water supplies. We can recycle a part of water that we used for washing to fill the cistern of the toilet. I believe it's more important that to know the amount of water that I use when I brush my teeth.  
  
The next problem is the oil. Much people throw away the oil that no longer uses by the water drainage. This oil is going to pollute the water of rivers and seas. The solution to this problem is simple. We must keep the oil in ecological containers. Later this oil is recycled and is used as fuel. But... where are these containers?  
  
To throw away the motor oil it's more serious because these oils contain toxic products. In the United Kingdom and the USA it is forbidden to spill oil in the sewer system. Here, I see this every day.

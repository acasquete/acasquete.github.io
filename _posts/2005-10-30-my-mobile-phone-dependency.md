Without a doubt, [mobile telephony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony) is one of the great technological advances of the last years. Forgetting the possible impact in the health of [radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health) produced by the microwaves of the mobile phones, the numerous advantages of mobile technology are undeniable.  
  
I use basically mobile phone to send and to receive calls and I can describe my use as "moderate". I call exclusively to my friends and some clients, and always to speak about something specific. Normally a conversation does not exceed of two minutes, but there're always exceptions. I don't understand phone conversations which extend eternally.  
  
Although I do not abuse of mobile phones, and I am not a habitual user of other services like connection to Internet and [short](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service) and [multimedia messages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_System), I confess that I do not leave my house without my cellular phone, and if sometimes I forget it (in rare occasions), I return to look for it. It is possibly the only disadvantage that I am suffering: mobile phone dependency.

[Mobile telephony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony) is undeniably one of the greatest technological advances of recent years. Setting aside potential health impacts of [radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health) from cell phones, the benefits of mobile technology are clear.

Primarily, I use my phone for calls, and I’d describe my usage as "moderate." I only call friends and a few clients, always with a specific purpose in mind. Most of my conversations don’t last more than two minutes, though there are, of course, exceptions. I simply don’t understand lengthy phone conversations.

Although I don’t overuse my mobile and rarely use other features like internet access, [SMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service), or [MMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_System), I admit I never leave home without it. If I do forget it (a rare occurrence), I often go back to retrieve it. This reliance may be the only real downside I experience: a subtle but noticeable dependence on my phone.

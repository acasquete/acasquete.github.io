[Mobile telephony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony) is undoubtedly one of the great technological advances of recent years. Forgetting the possible health impact of [radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health) produced by microwaves from cell phones, the many advantages of mobile technology are undeniable.  
  
I basically use my phone to send and receive calls and I can qualify my use as "moderate". I only call my friends and a few clients, and always to talk about something specific. Usually a conversation does not exceed two minutes, but there are always exceptions. I don't understand phone conversations that go on forever.  
  
Although I do not abuse mobiles, and I am not a regular user of other services such as Internet connection and [short messages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service) and [multimedia messages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_System), I confess that I do not leave home without my phone, and if I sometimes forget it (on rare occasions), I go back to get it. It is possibly the only drawback I suffer from: dependence on my cell phone.

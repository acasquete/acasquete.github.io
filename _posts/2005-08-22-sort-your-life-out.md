title: Sort your life out!
---
In these days I'm reviewing sort algorithms and I have created a class in C# that allows sorting ascending an integer array. Once I was read that there're not arrangement methods, only elements to sort, so this class has 5 static methods that implements the 5 different common types of sorting algorithms: Insert, Select, Bubble, Shell and QuickSort.  
All algorithms are sorting an array of integer numbers, although floats, characters could perfectly be used.  

The QuickSort algorithm is the one that better performance offers for any number of elements. The Select algorithm is relatively fast to order a reduced number of elements. Finally, BubbleSort is the algorithm simplest to implement but the one that worse performance offers. It's relatively useful to sort a low number of elements, but the sorting time grows exponentially as the size of the array is increased.

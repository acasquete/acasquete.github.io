The **.CAT** domain has been in the news this week. José Montilla, the [Minister of Industry and Tourism](http://www.min.es/), who attended the presentation of the initiative "[todos.es](http://www.todos.es)", has raised the possibility of the creation of .cat as an Internet domain. This is a historical demand of Catalan Internet users through the "[Campanya per un domini .CAT](http://www.puntcat.org)" ([Campaign for a .CAT domain](http://www.puntcat.org/default.asp?idioma=I)).  
  
However, it has not been approved by [ICANN](http://www.icann.org). Of the ten applications submitted in March for a sponsored top-level domain, only **.travel** and **.post** have a chance. The other eight proposals will have to wait longer.  
  
The president of the [Asociación Española de Internautas](http://www.internautas.org/) (AI), Víctor Domingo, said earlier this week that it was "practically impossible" for ICANN to grant the **.cat** domain to Catalonia because they are only granted to legally constituted countries, recognized by the United Nations.

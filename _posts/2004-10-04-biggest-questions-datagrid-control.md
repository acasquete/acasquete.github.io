How to format datagrid rows and columns, how to hide and add dynamic columns, how to select a row from any point, how to edit multiple rows at the same time, etc. These are some of the questions this [very good MSDN article](http://web.archive.org/web/20040905014530/http://www.microsoft.com/spanish/msdn/articulos/archivo/040402/voices/vbtchtopquestionsaboutaspnetdatagridservercontrol.asp) tries to answer.

Today there is a big difference in the use of information technology between poor and rich countries. The Information Revolution is comparable to the Industrial Revolution. All countries are participating in this revolution, but as with the Industrial Revolution, the difference between rich and poor countries is widening, although it is clear that all countries are making use of ICT products.

Everywhere, people are connected. Mobile phones are everywhere. Everybody knows what's going on on the other side of the world. Unfortunately, there are countries where the implementation and use of new technologies is very slow, almost non-existent, due to economic and social crises. There are countries where diseases and first-order deficiencies are much more important than being connected, but even so, these countries are participating in the Information Revolution.  
  
I believe that the economic development of a country and the use of ICTs are closely related. If a country participates in the Information Revolution, its economic development is higher. This implies that countries that do not have economic resources are less likely to participate in this revolution, they are disadvantaged. In fact, poor countries are economically dependent on richer countries in order not to miss out on the Information Revolution.

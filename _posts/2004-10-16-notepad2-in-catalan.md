title: Notepad2 in Catalan
---
We have now available the [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) Catalan and Korean translations. At this moment, I'm the person in charge of the Catalan version. If you're interested in catalan source code, please contact me.  
  
For those you don't know it, Notepad2 tries to follow the same principle of the original Notepad shipped with Windows, it's a small, fast and free text editor with syntax highlighting for HTML and other common languages. It's an excellent editor written by [Florian Balmer](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/).  
  
I hope the Catalan speakers knows how to enjoy it!

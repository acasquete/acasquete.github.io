The Catalan and Korean translations of [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) are now available. At this moment, I am the person in charge of the Catalan version. If you are interested in the Catalan source code, please contact me.  
  
For those who don't know it, Notepad2 tries to follow the same principle of the original Notepad that comes with Windows, it is a small, fast and free text editor with syntax highlighting for HTML and other common languages. It is an excellent editor written by [Florian Balmer](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/).  
  
I hope Catalan speakers will enjoy it!

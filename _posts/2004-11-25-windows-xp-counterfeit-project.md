title: Windows XP Counterfeit Project
---
Microsoft has announced a new attack on piracy. The company will be offering anyone who's unsure about whether they've got dodgy software the chance to have it checked out by Microsoft, with the promise that if it does turn out to be counterfeit, they'll replace it.  
  
To get a replacement copy of Windows XP, PC users will need to send off their receipt and complete a witness statement, revealing where they bought their knock-off software.

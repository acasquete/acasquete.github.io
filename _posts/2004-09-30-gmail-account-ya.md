It seems that everybody has a [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) account by now, or at least people who are familiar with this service. At [escomposlinux.org](http://www.escomposlinux.org), they even make a joke in their comic strip.

I've been looking for a way to get an account for a while now, and today I finally got it. It wasn't very [complicated](http://barrapunto.com/comments.pl?sid=44778&op=&threshold=0&commentsort=0&mode=thread&pid=361519#361582). 

My new personal email address is alexcprieto(nospam)gmail.com.

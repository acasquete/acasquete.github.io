title: Gmail account, Ya!
---
It seems that everybody already has a [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com) account, or at least people that knows this service. In [escomposlinux.org](http://www.escomposlinux.org), they even make a joke in your comic strip ([English](http://comic.escomposlinux.org/ecol-174-e.png), [Spanish](http://tira.escomposlinux.org/ecol-174.png)). A while ago that it looked for the form of getting an account and today I have finally gotten it. It has not been very [complicated](http://barrapunto.com/comments.pl?sid=44778&op=&threshold=0&commentsort=0&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mode=thread&pid=361519#361582). My new personal e-mail address is alexcprieto(nospam)gmail.com.

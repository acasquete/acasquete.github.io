Today I have decided to create this weblog to end my silence. I have also decided that my silence ends in English.

I hope that if anyone reads this weblog, they can forgive my English, as it is not good at all. I will practice with each post.

I don't know exactly to whom I will dedicate this space on the web. In fact, I will post news that have impacted me or have interested me.

I hope this will not be my last post.

title: Future trends in video games
---
Without a doubt, it's in the video games where we can see technological advance. If we looking back last fifteen years, we can see big differences in the method of playing and programming video games. But in some aspects, still today we have the same limitations. Our contact with the video reality itâ€™s always through a monitor and a keyboard. The most advanced that we have is a joystick or a steering wheel and virtual reality glasses.  
  
Technology someday will allow all of us to create virtual scenes that were not different from the real world. Perhaps someday we have a device able to simulate smells. And imagining a little more, someday we will connect with computer or console which willbe connected with everybody and we will create an alternative reality in our minds.  
  
This seems horrible, but I do not believe that technological advance leads to a dehumanized society and with everyone connected to a computer. The social relations will not disappear, unless we find in virtual world a society better than in the real world.

title: Reduce your telephone bill
---
A few days ago, a client told me to try [Skype](http://www.skype.com), a new communication software that uses P2P technology developed by the creators of [Kazaa](http://www.kazaa.com) and [Joltid](http://www.joltid.com). At first, I did not give it importance because I thought I would not find improvements compared to other applications that I had tried so far, but I was wrong. Today I have been able to verify that the sound quality is good, like a standard telephone, without delays. It allows conferences of up to 5 people and works with all firewalls, NATs, and routers.

So if you have installed Skype, you can call me [here](callto://alexcasquete).

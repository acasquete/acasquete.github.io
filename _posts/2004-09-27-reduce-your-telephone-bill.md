title: Reduce your telephone bill
---
Some days ago a customer told me that proves [Skype](http://www.skype.com), a new communication software that uses P2P technology developed by the creators of [Kazaa](http://www.kazaa.com) and [Joltid](http://www.joltid.com). In a first moment I didn't give him importance because I thought that not I would find improvements regarding other applications that I had proven up to now, but I was mistaken. Today I have been able to check that the sound quality is good, as a normal telephone, without retards, it allows conferences of up to 5 people and it also works with all the firewall, NAT and routers.

So if you have installed Skype you can call me [here](callto://alexcprieto).

title: Are Poor Countries Losing the Information Revolution?
---
Nowadays there's a big difference in the use of technology information between poor and rich countries. Information Revolution is comparable to the Industrial Revolution. All countries participate in this revolution, but like it has happened with Industrial Revolution, the difference between rich and poor countries is greater. And every time there is more difference, but it's clear that all countries are making use of ICT products.  
  
Everywhere, people are connected. Mobile phones are everywhere. Everybody knows what happens on the other side of the world. Unfortunately, there're countries in which the implantation and use of new technologies are very slow, almost nonexistent, due to economic and social crises. There're countries in which diseases and deficiencies of first order are much more important than to be connected, but even so those countries participate in the Information Revolution.  
  
I believe that the economic development of a country and the use of the ICT are closely related. If a country participates in the Information Revolution, their economic development is greater. This implies that the countries that do not have economic resources have fewer possibilities of participating in this revolution, they are underprivileged. Really, poor countries depend economically on the richest countries so as not to lose the Information Revolution.

title: .CAT domain, too near and too far!
---
**.CAT** domain has been in the news this week. José Montilla, the [Spanish industry and tourism minister](http://www.min.es/), who went to the presentation of the «[todos.es](http://www.todos.es)» initiative, has raised the possibility of the creation of .cat as an Internet domain. It's a historical claim of Catalonian internauts through «[Campanya per un domini .CAT](http://www.puntcat.org)» ([Campaign for a .CAT domain](http://www.puntcat.org/default.asp?idioma=I)).  
  
However, it hasn't received the [ICANN](http://www.icann.org)'s approval. Of the ten candidacies presented in March for the concession of a sponsored top-level domain -a smaller entity that the **.com**, **.net** and **.org**\-, only the domains **.travel** and **.post** have possibilities. The other eight proposals will have to wait for more time.  
  
The president of the [Spanish Internaut Association](http://www.internautas.org/) (AI), Victor Domingo, advanced at the beginning of the week that was «practically impossible» that the ICANN granted the domain **.cat** to Catalonia because they're only granted to legally constituted countries, recognized by the United Nations.

Today I read a [news](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/10/30/espana/1099138563.html) that left me quite impressed. The police have arrested three people, all of them linked to the emergency services of Madrid, accused of having taken the photos of mutilated corpses of victims of the 11-M attacks published on the Internet.

As some news reports said, it is still not clear what to accuse them of, because it is not known what crime they have done.  
  
But the most impressive (at least for me) is the following paragraph of the news:  

> "In barely an hour**, the Technological Investigation Brigade managed to contact the main Spanish operators in order to filter the accesses of users from our country** to some images that were producing consternation in the relatives of the victims, achieving that the page could not be visited from Spain".

Do you remember [article 8.2 of the LSSI](http://www.lssice.com/legislacion/lssice.html)?  
  
Can you imagine what could happen if any web page published things judged as inconvenient?

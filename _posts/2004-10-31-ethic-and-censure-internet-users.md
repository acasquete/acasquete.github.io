title: Ethic and censure. The Internet user's stronghold against the LSSI.
---
Today I have read a [news article](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/10/30/espana/1099138563.html) that left me quite impressed. The Police has arrested three persons, all them linked to the services of emergencies of Madrid, accused of taked the mutilated cadavers pictures of 11-M attacks' victims published in Internet.  
As they said any informatives, it is not still known very well of what to accuse them, because one doesn't know that crime has made.  
  
But the most impressive thing (at least for me) it is the following news' paragraph:  

> _«**In hardly one hour**, the Brigade of Technological Investigation was able to contact with the main Spanish carriers with the purpose of that they **filtered the accesses of the users from our country** to some images that were producing consternation in the relatives of the victims, obtaining that the page could not be visited from Spain.»_

  
Do you remember the [article 8.2 of the LSSI](http://www.lssice.com/legislacion/lssice.html)?  
  
Do you imagine what could happen if any Web site published things judged inconvenient?

One [news](https://elpais.com/diario/2005/09/30/espana/1128031201_850215.html) that has impressed me so much in the last few days has been the "avalanche" of hundreds of immigrants trying to climb the border fence in Ceuta. The avalanche finished with five immigrants dead and hundreds injured. Now we know that shots of Moroccan police possibly caused this avalanche and the deaths, and the massive jump was not deliberate.

Maybe the later reactions and declarations of the political leaders of government and opposition have surprised me more. The Secretary-General of the PP, Ángel Acebes, dared to say that these facts are incited by the "call effect" caused by the law on foreign citizens and the process of regulation that facilitates obtaining the papers. I want to ask Acebes if he thinks what he says and if he does not think that those avalanches are caused, on the contrary, by an «escape effect» from the origin countries.

Another image that has impressed me is when our army appears defending our borders from the "foreign invasion". I did not see similar action from July of 2002, from the "liberation" of Perejil Island. I would like to ask the defense minister if he does not believe that sending soldiers armed with guns is excessive and extreme to protect the fence of immigrants, which the only thing they have is fear and hunger.

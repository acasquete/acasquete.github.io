title: Escape effect
---
One of the news that has impressed me so much in the last days has been the «avalanche» of hundreds of immigrants trying to climb the border fence in Ceuta. The avalanche finished with five immigrants dead and hundreds injured. Now we know that this avalanche and the deaths were possibly caused by shots of Moroccan police and the massive jump was not premeditated.  
  
Maybe the later reactions and declarations of the political leaders of government and opposition have surprised me still more. The Secretary General of the PP, Ángel Acebes, dared to say that these facts are incited by the «call effect» caused by the law on foreign citizens and the process of regulation that facilitates obtaining the papers. I would like to ask Acebes if he really thinks what he says, and if he does not think that those avalanches are caused, on the contrary, by an «escape effect» from the origin countries.  
  
Another image that has impressed me is the one in which our army appears defending our borders of the «foreign invasion». I did not see a similar action from July of 2002, from the «liberation» of Perejil Island. In this case I would like to ask the defense minister if he does not believe that the decision to send soldiers armed with guns is excessive and extreme to protect the fence of immigrants, which the only thing that they have is fear and hunger.

A [shocking news item](https://elpais.com/diario/2005/09/30/espana/1128031201_850215.html) has been the "avalanche" of hundreds of migrants trying to climb the border fence in Ceuta. The avalanche ended with five migrants dead and hundreds injured. We now know that Moroccan police fire possibly caused this avalanche and the deaths, and that the mass jumping was not deliberate.

But perhaps what has surprised me most have been the subsequent reactions and statements from the political leaders of the government and the opposition position. The secretary general of the PP, √Ångel Acebes, dared to say that these events are incited by the "call effect" provoked by the law on foreign citizens and the regulation process that makes it easier to obtain papers. I would like to ask Acebes if he thinks what he says and if he does not believe that these avalanches are provoked, on the contrary, by an "escape effect" from the countries of origin.

Another impressive image is the one showing our army defending our borders from "foreign invasion". I have not seen a similar action since July 2002, since the "liberation" of Perejil Island. I would like to ask the Minister of Defence if he does not think that sending soldiers armed with firearms is excessive and extreme to protect the encirclement of immigrants, who have nothing but fear and hunger.

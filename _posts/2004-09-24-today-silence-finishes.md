title: Today the silence finishes

Today I've decided to create this web log to finish with my silence. I've also been decided that my silence finishes in English. 

I wait that if somebody reads this web log, know how to forgive my English, since it is not for anything good. I will go practicing with each publication. 

I don't know exactly to that will dedicate this space in the web, I will surely go publishing news that have impacted me or interested. 

I hope that this one is not my last publication.

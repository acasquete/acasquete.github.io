title: Today the silence finishes

Today I’ve decided to create this weblog to finish with my silence. I’ve also decided that my silence finishes in English.

I hope that if someone reads this weblog, he can forgive my English as it is not good at all. I will practice with each publication.

I don’t know exactly to that will dedicate this space on the web. I will indeed publish news that has impacted or interested me.

I hope that this one is not my last publication.
